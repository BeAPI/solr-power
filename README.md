Improve your user experience with the Apache Solr search engine for your WordPress website.

## Description ##

Search is critical for your site, but the default search for WordPress leaves a lot to be desired. Improve your user experience with the Apache Solr search engine for your WordPress website.

* Fast results, with better accuracy
* Enable faceting on fields such as tags, categories, author, and page type.
* Indexing and faceting on custom fields
* Completely replaces default WordPress search, just install and configure.
* Completely integrated into default WordPress theme and search widget.
* Very developer-friendly: uses the modern [Solarium](http://www.solarium-project.org/] library)

## Installation ##

First install the plugin as per normal. If you are installing on Pantheon, you will need to enable the Apache Solr add-on before you can enable the plugin.

1. Index your existing content by going to the plugin options screen and clicking "index content".
2. Replace the core search widget with the one from this plugin.
3. Search on!
4. See the examples/templates directories for more rich implementation guidelines.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
